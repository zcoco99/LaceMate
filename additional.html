      <h5 class="p-2">This website is built for Team LaceMate, as part of the Horizon course: Making and Prototyping for Research and Products 2019-2020 at Imperial College London.
        <br>The website is built based on the Bootstrap template <a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-one-page-wonder">"One page wonder"</a>, which
        includes pre-developed CSS and JavaScript files, and generically structured HTML files which can easily be edited with relevant content for my site. This saves me the time of writing CSS and JavaScript files myself, and gives me more time to focus on choosing the content to present on the website.
        <br>My HTML and CSS file editing was done in Atom IDE, which supports all of the languages required for this project and has useful syntax highlighting and suggestions.
        <br>Git version control was also used to keep track of changes made to the site and also to enable me to publicly host the website for free via my <a href="https://github.com/zcoco99/LaceMate">GitHub account</a>.

    <div class="row">
      <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-2">Domain</h4>
      <h5 class="p-2">This website is published using URL generated based on my GitHub repository. The current domain name includes "LaceMate" with default GitHub domain prefixes.
        This is an easy and free way of getting a domain for our product website. It is also easier to adjust website contents regularly using GitHub domain at this stage.
        <br>In future stage of project development, it would be more ideal to register/purchase a public domain name that is more simple and easier to find, for example "www.lacemate.com".
        Many companies offer both of these services and also provide an online platform for accessing the server and using it for other purposes, for example email or to databases for sales records.

    <div class="row">
      <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-2">Websites</h4>
      <h5 class="p-2">A good website should be easy to read and navigate, at the same time
        provide relevant and adequate information in each section of the website.
        Essential information about the company or the product of the website should be shown and explained clearly using clear and precise language.
        An interactive landing page with well-planned presentation of information also makes the website more engaging for users.
        <br><br>An accessible website means that the website should be usable for people of all age, abilities and knowledge background.
        <br>I have used high color contrasts in every page of the website with consistent color palette, with text in large and readable fonts.
        Uplifting color palette can make the page seem more interesting and engage users of younger age.
        Alt tags are added to all images and videos, this makes the website accessible for those with visual impairments using screen readers.
        <br><br>Some of the most important considerations that must be made by web designers and devlopers regard privacy.
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area.
        Under the terms of GDPR, not only do organisations have to ensure that personal data is gathered legally and under strict conditions,
        but those who collect and manage it are obliged to protect it from misuse and exploitation,
        as well as to respect the rights of data owners - or face penalties for not doing so.
        It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. In accordance with these regulations,
        we would make sure that our website is registered under a secure server and that we do not hold onto any of our customers' personal information without their permission.
        <br><br>When publishing our website, we would need to consider search engine optimisation (SEO) and various marketing techniques such as advertisements, promotions and demonstrations.
        By optimizing our website structure and including search keywords in HTML scripts, our project website can be more visible for people seaching for relevant keywords.
        Taking this project further, I would like to do live demonstrations of our product at potentially relevant events, as well as investing some money in targetted advertisements
         via social media and editing the textual content of our website in accordance with SEO principles.

        <br><br>If we had more time, I would like to improve my website to include a video demonstration of the product as the background for the landing page,
        as well as case studies for people who have tested our product and a page at which our product could be purchased. I would also like to improve the layout of each page on the website,
        as the current layout is not very well aligned and is lacking more renders/images of product itself.
