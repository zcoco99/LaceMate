      <h5 class="p-2">This website is built for Team LaceMate, as part of the Horizon course: Making and Prototyping for Research and Products 2019-2020 at Imperial College London.
        <br>The website is built based on the Bootstrap template <a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-one-page-wonder">"One page wonder"</a>, which
        includes pre-developed CSS and JavaScript files, and generically structured HTML files which can easily be edited with relevant content for my site. This saves me the time of writing CSS and JavaScript files myself, and gives me more time to focus on choosing the content to present on the website.
        <br>My HTML and CSS file editing was done in Atom IDE, which supports all of the languages required for this project and has useful syntax highlighting and suggestions.
        <br>Git version control was also used to keep track of changes made to the site and also to enable me to publicly host the website for free via my <a href="https://github.com/zcoco99/LaceMate">GitHub account</a>.

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-2">Domain</h4>
      <h5 class="p-2">This website is published using URL generated based on my GitHub repository. The current domain name includes "LaceMate" with default GitHub domain prefixes.
        This is an easy and free way of getting a domain for our product website. It is also easier to adjust website contents regularly using GitHub domain at this stage.
        <br>In future stage of project development, it would be more ideal to register/purchase a public domain name that is more simple and easier to find, for example "www.lacemate.com".
        Many companies offer both of these services and also provide an online platform for accessing the server and using it for other purposes, for example email or to databases for sales records.

      <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-2">Websites</h4>
      <h5 class="p-2">A good website should be easy to read and navigate, at the same time
        provide relevant and adequate information in each section of the website.
        Essential information about the company or the product of the website should be shown and explained clearly using clear and precise language.
        An interactive landing page with well-planned presentation of information also makes the website more engaging for users.
        <br><br>An accessible website means that the website should be usable for people of all age, abilities and knowledge background.
